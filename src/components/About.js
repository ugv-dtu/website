          <p className="about-intro">
            UGV-DTU is a team of undergraduate students at Delhi Technological University working on autonomous ground vehicle technology. The team was formed with a clear national goal: to build a 'Made in India' solution for complete vehicular autonomy that is specifically designed for Indian road conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="about-details">
            Unlike most self-driving vehicle research which is targeted at structured western road environments, UGV-DTU focuses on the unique challenges of Indian roads: unstructured traffic, poor lane discipline, unpredictable obstacles, and varied terrain. The team works across mechanical engineering, electronics, computer vision, and robotics software to build fully integrated autonomous platforms from scratch.
          </p>
          <p className="about-details">
            The team designs, builds, and validates unmanned ground vehicles end-to-end. On the hardware side, this includes custom chassis fabrication, suspension systems, drivetrain assembly, and integration of sensors such as LiDAR, stereo cameras, IMU, and GPS/RTK modules. On the software side, the team develops a full ROS 2-based autonomous navigation stack featuring SLAM for real-time mapping, Nav2 for path planning, EKF for sensor fusion, and custom computer vision pipelines for lane detection and obstacle recognition.
